#  Language-Classification

##  Project Description
Language Classification is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the goal is to identify the language of a given text input. This capability is essential for various multilingual applications such as search engines, voice assistants, chatbots, and real-time translation systems.In this project, we developed a machine learning-based system that can automatically detect the language of a given short text or sentence. The system was trained using a multilingual dataset containing over 2,800 text samples labeled in different languages such as English, Afrikaans, and Nederlands. The text samples were carefully preprocessed and vectorized to transform them into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.Algorithms used Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier.

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (for model training)

##  Dataset
The dataset consists of **2,839** text entries labeled with their respective languages.  
Each entry includes:

- `text`: A sentence or phrase in a particular language  
- `language`: The corresponding language label for the text

## Results
- Accuracy: Model Comparison

- Confusion Matrix: Shows effective separation between languages
