# Language-Classification
#Project Description
#Language classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps in multilingual applications such as chatbots, translation services, and search engines. This project builds a Machine learning model to classify short text snippets into their respective languages. We trained the model on a dataset containing multiple languages with balanced text samples.The model is capable of distinguishing between languages based on the unique patterns, characters, and structures used in the text.

#Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
#Dataset
The dataset consists of 2,839 text entries labeled with their respective languages. Each entry includes:
text: A sentence or phrase in a particular language
language: The corresponding language label for the text
